# Ruzzle

Sokoban engine, written in Ruby. Compiled into JS for browser via Opal.

Ultimately the idea is to write a DSL similar to [Stephen Lavelle's PuzzleScript](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript) so users can create their own games and rulesets and compile them live in the browser.

Ultimately just an experiment to play around w/ Opal. Would be much simpler to just write all logic and DSL in JS than deal w/ Ruby at all, but I like Ruby.
